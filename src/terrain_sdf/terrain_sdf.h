/**
 * @file terrain_sdf.h
 *
 * Signed-distance-field (SDF) sphere tracer for SIH world-aware sensors.
 *
 * Companion library to `lib/terrain`. Where `lib/terrain` handles the
 * procedural heightfield + a near-vertical analytical raycast, this
 * library handles arbitrary-direction beams against a `min()`-composed
 * scene of analytic primitive SDFs (`sdf_box`, `sdf_cylinder`,
 * `sdf_sphere`, `sdf_plane`) plus a loose heightfield SDF wrapping
 * `terrain()`. The traversal algorithm is Hart 1996 sphere tracing:
 * step along the ray by the SDF value at each iterate; that step is
 * guaranteed not to cross the surface because the SDF lower-bounds the
 * Euclidean distance to it.
 *
 * Used by SIH's `send_obstacle_distance()` (72-bin obstacle ring) and the
 * non-downward branches of `send_dist_snsr()` (forward / side / up
 * rangefinders) so they can see static man-made geometry that doesn't
 * live in the procedural heightfield.
 *
 * ## Frame convention (pinned — altitude-up everywhere)
 *
 * All coordinates in this library use the **altitude-up** convention:
 *
 * - `sdf_vec3.n` — north metres (NED north axis)
 * - `sdf_vec3.e` — east  metres (NED east  axis)
 * - `sdf_vec3.alt` — altitude metres, **positive up**
 *
 * The altitude axis is the negation of the NED "down" axis. A ray
 * pointing toward the ground has `dir_unit.alt < 0`; a ray pointing
 * skyward has `dir_unit.alt > 0`. Callers that hold their state in NED
 * with positive-down must flip the Z sign at the boundary
 * (`sdf_vec3.alt = -ned.d`).
 *
 * This convention matches the standard SDF / computer-graphics
 * convention (Quilez 2008) and matches `lib/terrain`'s height return
 * (`terrain()` returns altitude, positive up). It does NOT match raw
 * NED state. The convention is enforced at the library boundary; the
 * library itself never sees a "down" component.
 *
 * ## Scene model
 *
 * The scene is a fixed-capacity (`SDF_MAX_PRIMS`) flat list of analytic
 * primitives, evaluated with `min()` composition (union semantics). No
 * dynamic allocation; the list lives in BSS. Primitives are added with
 * `sdf_scene_add()` and the list is reset with `sdf_scene_clear()`.
 *
 * The heightfield SDF (an altitude-up wrapper around `terrain()`) is
 * always part of the scene; callers do not need to add it explicitly.
 * The heightfield wrapper is loose (not strictly 1-Lipschitz on steep
 * slopes), which is why the tracer floors its step at
 * `SDF_SPHERE_TRACE_MIN_STEP` — see the contract on `sdf_sphere_trace`.
 *
 * ## Primitive semantics
 *
 * Each `sdf_prim_t` is `{ type, center, extent, cos_yaw, sin_yaw }`. The
 * `extent` channels encode primitive-specific dimensions:
 *
 *   `SDF_PRIM_BOX`      — box rotated about the altitude axis by yaw.
 *                         `extent` = half-widths along the wall's
 *                         LOCAL (rotated) (n, e, alt) axes —
 *                         `extent.n` is the half-length along the long
 *                         axis, `extent.e` the half-thickness across
 *                         it, `extent.alt` the half-height. The
 *                         primitive's `cos_yaw` / `sin_yaw` are the
 *                         precomputed N-E-plane rotation that maps
 *                         world coordinates into the wall's local frame
 *                         before the axis-aligned box SDF is evaluated.
 *   `SDF_PRIM_CYLINDER` — vertical cylinder; `extent.n` = radius,
 *                         `extent.e` unused, `extent.alt` = half-height.
 *                         Cylinder axis is parallel to the altitude axis.
 *                         Rotation fields ignored.
 *   `SDF_PRIM_SPHERE`   — sphere; `extent.n` = radius, other channels
 *                         unused. Rotation fields ignored.
 *   `SDF_PRIM_PLANE`    — infinite horizontal plane at altitude
 *                         `center.alt`, normal pointing up. SDF is
 *                         `p.alt - center.alt` (above = positive).
 *                         `extent` and rotation fields unused.
 *
 * Negative extents are not validated; callers pass non-negative values.
 *
 * ## Rotation field
 *
 * `sdf_prim_t` carries `cos_yaw` / `sin_yaw` so that walls
 * placed by `scene_wall_at_cell()` (lib/terrain_sdf/scene.c) can sit at
 * arbitrary yaw in the N-E plane. The fields are precomputed at wall
 * generation time so the sphere tracer's `sdf_box()` body — called
 * ~216 k times per second under the obstacle ring (72 bins × ~10 steps
 * × ~30 prims × 10 Hz) — stays free of `sinf` / `cosf` calls. Per-call
 * cost is 4 muls + 2 adds + 2 subs for the rotation, vs ~4–5 % of a
 * 480 MHz Cortex-M7 core if the trig were evaluated on the hot path.
 *
 * Primitives where rotation has no geometric meaning (cylinder about
 * the altitude axis, sphere, horizontal plane) ignore the fields. The
 * memory cost is paid uniformly anyway because the scene array is a
 * fixed-stride `sdf_prim_t[]`.
 *
 * ## Origin-inside contract (pinned)
 *
 * `sdf_sphere_trace` returns the sentinel value `-1.f` when the ray
 * origin lies inside scene geometry — i.e. when
 * `scene_eval(origin) < 0`. Callers must map `-1.f` to "vehicle is
 * clipping geometry; report zero distance with quality marker", not to
 * "no hit found" (which is `max_t`). Mapping it to a clear reading when
 * the beam origin is already inside geometry would under-warn collision
 * prevention.
 *
 * ## API stability
 *
 * Signature changes require coordination with the companion viewer,
 * which compiles the same source. Adding new primitive types is
 * non-breaking; reordering or renaming enum values is breaking.
 *
