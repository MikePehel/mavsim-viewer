 * VENDORED FROM PX4-Autopilot — DO NOT MODIFY LOCALLY.
 *
 * Source: PX4-Autopilot/src/lib/terrain_sdf/terrain_sdf.c
 * Upstream commit: eecb4cb490 (lattice walls replace fBm terrain)
 *
 * DO NOT VENDOR intermediate SHAs (do not bump the pin to any of these):
         *   - 4235eaab7b  procedural + tall walls (retracted by the lattice redesign)
 *   - 7f0840f526  short-walls intermediate (superseded)
 *   - 472521144a  static-walls initial ship (lacks per-seed variation)
 *
 * This file is a verbatim copy of the shared source from the PX4 firmware
 * tree. The viewer side compiles the same bytes so the rendered surface
 * and the SDF obstacle scene are bit-identical to what the simulated
 * drone flew against. Do not change anything below this banner without
 * an upstream API Change Proposal — both sides must agree before
 * either moves.
 *
 * Re-syncing:
 *   1. Diff against the upstream copy at the pinned SHA:
 *        diff src/lib/terrain_sdf/terrain_sdf.c \
 *             $PX4_ROOT/src/lib/terrain_sdf/terrain_sdf.c
 *      (Only this banner should differ.)
 *   2. If upstream advanced AND the change is API-compatible:
 *        cp $PX4_ROOT/src/lib/terrain_sdf/terrain_sdf.c src/lib/terrain_sdf/terrain_sdf.c
 *      then re-insert this banner and bump the "Upstream commit" SHA.
 *   3. If upstream changes break the API surface, STOP and post an ACP
 *      before pulling.
 *   4. Re-run the determinism harness (tests/terrain/determinism_test.*)
 *      against the freshly vendored copy. Update the reference vectors
 *      ONLY if upstream intentionally changed the noise math; otherwise
 *      treat a mismatch as a regression.

 * Sphere tracer + analytic primitive SDFs for SIH world-aware sensors.
 *
 * Algorithm:  Hart 1996 sphere tracing over a min()-composed scene.
 * Primitives: Quilez 2008 closed-form signed-distance functions
 *             (box, vertical cylinder, sphere, horizontal plane).
 * Heightfield: a loose altitude-up SDF wrapping terrain() from
 *              `lib/terrain` — see scene_eval() for the contract.
 *
 * Frame: altitude-up everywhere (`sdf_vec3.alt` positive up). NED
 *        callers flip Z at the boundary. See terrain_sdf.h.
 *

 * Constraints (matching `lib/terrain`):

 *   - No heap, no dynamic allocation. Scene lives in BSS.

 * Tracer tuning constants.
 *
 * SDF_HIT_EPS — surface band: |scene_eval(p)| < HIT_EPS is a hit. 0.02 m
 *               (2 cm) is well below SIH rangefinder reporting resolution
 *               (1 cm), so a hit at this band reports the same integer
 *               distance the surface itself would.
 *
 * SDF_MAX_ITER — Hart 1996 step budget. At 64 iters with the MIN_STEP
 *                floor (0.05 m) the tracer can clear ≥ 3.2 m of stalled
 *                travel before bailing — covers tangent grazes against
 *                the heightfield where the loose wrapper isn't
 *                1-Lipschitz.
 *
 * SDF_SPHERE_TRACE_MIN_STEP — step floor. The heightfield SDF
 *                (`p.alt - terrain(p.n, p.e)`) is the vertical-distance
 *                approximation; on steep slopes it under-estimates the
 *                true Euclidean distance to the surface, meaning a
 *                naive step by `d` can stall arbitrarily close to but
 *                not at the surface. The floor guarantees forward
 *                progress; the stagnation counter caps the cost of
 *                grinding through near-tangent geometry.

 * authored with `cos_yaw = 1, sin_yaw = 0` and pay nothing on the

 * (the closest point on the heightfield is in general not directly

 * — that is what SDF_SPHERE_TRACE_MIN_STEP + the stagnation counter

 * scene_walls_sdf — loose, local wall-field SDF.
 *
 * The obstacle-mode analogue of terrain(). Walls are not a stored list; they
 * are a deterministic function of (seed, cell) — scene_wall_at_cell() is to
 * walls what terrain() is to hills. So we never iterate a list: at a sample
 * point we look only at the lattice cells local to it, exactly the way
 * terrain() reads only the noise under the point.
 *
 * A wall reaches at most ~one cell beyond its own cell, so a fixed
 * WALL_QUERY_RADIUS_CELLS neighbourhood around the sample cell contains any
 * wall whose surface can be near the point. Most cells are empty and
 * short-circuit on the cheap presence hash; only a couple of cells hold a
 * wall, so the cost is a couple of box evaluations per step regardless of how
 * many walls the seed places anywhere in the world.
 *
 * When no local wall is found we return WALL_CELL_SPACING_M as a guaranteed-
 * clear bound rather than the true distance to some distant wall: any wall
 * outside the searched neighbourhood is farther than this, so the sphere
 * tracer re-evaluates the next cell before it could step past one. This is
 * the same loose-but-safe contract terrain's vertical-distance SDF relies on
 * (the min-step floor + stagnation counter absorb the looseness). It is
 * deliberately NOT a tight global "nearest wall" — that would force a
 * content-dependent search, which is the whole cost we are removing.
