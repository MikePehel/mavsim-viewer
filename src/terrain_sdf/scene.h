 * VENDORED FROM PX4-Autopilot — DO NOT MODIFY LOCALLY.
 *
 * Source: PX4-Autopilot/src/lib/terrain_sdf/scene.h
 * Upstream commit: eecb4cb490 (lattice walls replace fBm terrain)
 *
 * DO NOT VENDOR intermediate SHAs (do not bump the pin to any of these):
         *   - 4235eaab7b  procedural + tall walls (retracted by the lattice redesign)
 *   - 7f0840f526  short-walls intermediate (superseded)
 *   - 472521144a  static-walls initial ship (lacks per-seed variation)
 *
 * This file is a verbatim copy of the shared source from the PX4 firmware
 * tree. The viewer side compiles the same bytes so the rendered surface
 * and the SDF obstacle scene are bit-identical to what the simulated
 * drone flew against. Do not change anything below this banner without
 * an upstream API Change Proposal — both sides must agree before
 * either moves.
 *
 * Re-syncing:
 *   1. Diff against the upstream copy at the pinned SHA:
 *        diff src/lib/terrain_sdf/scene.h \
 *             $PX4_ROOT/src/lib/terrain_sdf/scene.h
 *      (Only this banner should differ.)
 *   2. If upstream advanced AND the change is API-compatible:
 *        cp $PX4_ROOT/src/lib/terrain_sdf/scene.h src/lib/terrain_sdf/scene.h
 *      then re-insert this banner and bump the "Upstream commit" SHA.
 *   3. If upstream changes break the API surface, STOP and post an ACP
 *      before pulling.
 *   4. Re-run the determinism harness (tests/terrain/determinism_test.*)
 *      against the freshly vendored copy. Update the reference vectors
 *      ONLY if upstream intentionally changed the noise math; otherwise
 *      treat a mismatch as a regression.

/**
 * @file scene.h
 *
 * Procedural SDF wall lattice for SIH.
 *
 * Companion to `terrain_sdf.h`. Walls are derived from the shared
 * `SIH_TERR_SEED` via `hash3d(seed ^ WALL_HASH_SALT ^ cell_pack,
 * channel, 0)`. PX4 firmware and the companion viewer compile the same
 * source and produce identical primitive layouts — the same
 * bytes-must-match contract that already protects the integer hash
 * exported from `lib/terrain`. No MAVLink transport required for the
 * scene.
 *
 * ## Lattice walls
 *
 * Wall placement is a value-noise-style lattice: each cell
 * `(i_cell, j_cell)` in a fixed grid around home is independently
 * hashed, and that hash drives wall presence + dimensions. In walls
 * mode the `terrain()` heightfield is flat; the only ground geometry
 * above the flat floor is whatever this generator produces.
 *
 * ## Wall lattice geometry
 *
 * Each cell draws from six independent hash channels:
 *
 *   channel 0 (PRESENCE):  wall iff hash_to_unit_float < WALL_PRESENCE_P
 *   channel 1 (N_OFF):     N-offset of wall centre within cell, clamped
 *                          so the rotated wall's bounding box stays
 *                          inside its cell (best-effort; long walls at
 *                          adverse yaw can spill into adjacent cells)
 *   channel 2 (E_OFF):     E-offset within cell, same semantics
 *   channel 3 (LENGTH):    long-axis length, uniform on [WALL_MIN_LEN_M,
 *                          WALL_MAX_LEN_M)
 *   channel 4 (HEIGHT):    height, uniform on [WALL_HEIGHT_MIN_M,
 *                          WALL_HEIGHT_MAX_M)
 *   channel 5 (YAW):       yaw of the long axis in the N-E plane,
 *                          uniform on [0, π) — yaw+π is the same box
 *                          so the half-circle covers all orientations
 *
 * Walls are `sdf_box` primitives carrying precomputed `cos_yaw` /
 * `sin_yaw` so the sphere tracer can rotate the query point into the
 * wall's local frame without per-trace trig (see `terrain_sdf.h`).
 *
 * ## Home clearance
 *
 * Cells whose centre lies within `WALL_HOME_CLEARANCE_M` of home
 * produce no wall (`scene_wall_at_cell` returns `false`). With the
 * default `WALL_CELL_SPACING_M = 10` and `WALL_HOME_CLEARANCE_M = 15`,
 * the (0, 0) cell plus the eight 1-step neighbours are guaranteed
 * clear — vehicle home-spawn radius is unobstructed regardless of seed.
 *
 * ## API
 *
 *   scene_wall_at_cell(i, j, *out)  — returns true iff cell (i, j)
 *                                    hosts a wall; fills *out with the
 *                                    primitive on true.
 *
 * SIH iterates `(i, j) ∈ [-WALL_CELL_RADIUS_CELLS,
 * +WALL_CELL_RADIUS_CELLS]²` and adds each true-return primitive to
 * the SDF scene when `SIH_TERR_EN = 2` (walls mode). The default 5-cell radius =
 * 121 cells = ~40-60 walls at typical seed (presence × post-clearance
 * fraction). The actual wall count for a given seed can be inspected
 * with `Tools/scene_query`.
