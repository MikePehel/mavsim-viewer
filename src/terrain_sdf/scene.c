/* ============================================================================
 * VENDORED FROM PX4-Autopilot — DO NOT MODIFY LOCALLY.
 *
 * Source: PX4-Autopilot/src/lib/terrain_sdf/scene.c
 * Upstream commit: eecb4cb490 (perf(terrain_sdf): evaluate wall lattice as
 *   an on-demand SDF field — two perpendicular axis-aligned orientations,
 *   no trig, no stored list)
 * Prior pin: 6c1e3da4a1 (lattice walls, continuous-yaw)
 *
 * DO NOT VENDOR intermediate SHAs (do not bump the pin to any of these):
         *   - 4235eaab7b  procedural + tall walls (retracted by the lattice redesign)
 *   - 7f0840f526  short-walls intermediate (superseded)
 *   - 472521144a  static-walls initial ship (lacks per-seed variation)
 *
 * This file is a verbatim copy of the shared source from the PX4 firmware
 * tree. The viewer side compiles the same bytes so the rendered surface
 * and the SDF obstacle scene are bit-identical to what the simulated
 * drone flew against. Do not change anything below this banner without
 * an upstream API Change Proposal — both sides must agree before
 * either moves.
 *
 * Re-syncing:
 *   1. Diff against the upstream copy at the pinned SHA:
 *        diff src/lib/terrain_sdf/scene.c \
 *             $PX4_ROOT/src/lib/terrain_sdf/scene.c
 *      (Only this banner should differ.)
 *   2. If upstream advanced AND the change is API-compatible:
 *        cp $PX4_ROOT/src/lib/terrain_sdf/scene.c src/lib/terrain_sdf/scene.c
 *      then re-insert this banner and bump the "Upstream commit" SHA.
 *   3. If upstream changes break the API surface, STOP and post an ACP
 *      before pulling.
 *   4. Re-run the determinism harness (tests/terrain/determinism_test.*)
 *      against the freshly vendored copy. Update the reference vectors
 *      ONLY if upstream intentionally changed the noise math; otherwise
 *      treat a mismatch as a regression.

 * Procedural SDF wall lattice for SIH. See scene.h for the geometry
 * contract.
 *
 * This reinterprets the terrain noise lattice: each cell hash means
 * "is there a wall here, and what shape" instead of summing into an
 * elevation. Same hash primitive (`hash3d` from `lib/terrain`), same
 * bytes-must-match guarantee with the companion viewer; different
 * meaning.
 *
 * Constraints (matching `lib/terrain` and `lib/terrain_sdf`):
 *   - Pure C, only <math.h> + <stdint.h>.
 *   - No heap, no dynamic allocation.
 *   - Bit-exact integer hash across ARM Cortex-M7 / x86_64 / wasm32.
