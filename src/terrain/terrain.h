/* ============================================================================
 * VENDORED FROM PX4-Autopilot — DO NOT MODIFY LOCALLY.
 *
 * Source: PX4-Autopilot/src/lib/terrain/terrain.h
 * Upstream commit: eecb4cb490 (restores the fBm terrain elevation
 *                  pipeline; walls + elevation now coexist as sibling
 *                  consumers of the shared SIH_TERR_SEED hash)
 *
 * Previous pin: 6c1e3da4a1, where lattice walls replaced fBm.
 * The current pin restores `terrain.{c,h}` to its earlier form (the fBm
 * value-noise pipeline with Quilez octave rotation + erosion divisor)
 * while leaving the wall lattice (`scene.{c,h}`,
 * `terrain_sdf.{c,h}`) byte-identical. `terrain_set_params()` grows back
 * from 4 args to 6 args: (amp, wavelength, seed, home_n, home_e,
 * plane_deg). When `amp == 0` the function still returns 0 everywhere,
 * preserving the SIH_TERR_EN=0 baseline.
 *
 * DO NOT VENDOR intermediate SHAs (do not bump the pin to any of these):
 *   - 4235eaab7b  procedural + tall walls (retracted by the lattice redesign)
 *   - 7f0840f526  short-walls intermediate (superseded)
 *   - 472521144a  static-walls initial ship (lacks per-seed variation)
 *
 * This file is a verbatim copy of the shared source from the PX4 firmware
 * tree. The viewer side compiles the same bytes so the rendered surface
 * and the SDF obstacle scene are bit-identical to what the simulated
 * drone flew against. Do not change anything below this banner without
 * an upstream API Change Proposal — both sides must agree before
 * either moves.
 *
 * Re-syncing:
 *   1. Diff against the upstream copy at the pinned SHA:
 *        diff src/lib/terrain/terrain.h \
 *             $PX4_ROOT/src/lib/terrain/terrain.h
 *      (Only this banner should differ.)
 *   2. If upstream advanced AND the change is API-compatible:
 *        cp $PX4_ROOT/src/lib/terrain/terrain.h src/lib/terrain/terrain.h
 *      then re-insert this banner and bump the "Upstream commit" SHA.
 *   3. If upstream changes break the API surface, STOP and post an ACP
 *      before pulling.
 *   4. Re-run the determinism harness (tests/terrain/determinism_test.*)
 *      against the freshly vendored copy. Update the reference vectors
 *      ONLY if upstream intentionally changed the noise math; otherwise
 *      treat a mismatch as a regression.

/**
 * @file terrain.h
 *
 * Procedural terrain library for SIH (Simulation-In-Hardware).
 *
 * Provides a pure deterministic terrain height function and a beam-vs-terrain
 * raycast helper. Used by the SIH simulator to give the otherwise-flat
 * `z = 0` floor a procedural shape and to feed world-aware sensors
 * (downward / forward / side rangefinders) with realistic ground returns.
 *
 * ## Frame convention (pinned)
 *
 * - `terrain(north_m, east_m)` operates in NED (North-East-Down). North
 *   increases northward, east eastward, both in metres from the home
 *   reference set via `terrain_set_params()`.
 * - By construction `terrain(home_N, home_E) = 0`. This is enforced by
 *   subtracting `terrain(0, 0)` from every evaluation so the vehicle
 *   never spawns buried or floating at `SIH_LOC_H0`.
 * - Height is positive *up*. Returning `+5.f` means the terrain surface
 *   sits 5 m above the home altitude reference.
 * - The companion viewer uses raylib Y-up. It is responsible for applying
 *   the NED -> Y-up transform `(N, E, D) -> (E, -D, N)` *before* evaluating
 *   this function on its side. The function itself knows nothing about Y-up.
 *
 * ## Shared source contract
 *
 * This file (and `terrain.c`) is the physical source of truth for the
 * terrain shape on BOTH the firmware side (PX4) and the companion viewer
 * side. Both compile the same bytes. Constraints:
 *
 * - Pure C (no C++, no STL, no PX4 headers).
 * - Only `<math.h>` essentials (`sinf`, `cosf`, `floorf`, `sqrtf`, `powf`).
 * - No global heap, no dynamic allocation.
 * - The integer hash layer is bit-exact across ARM Cortex-M7 and x86_64.
 *   Float fBm accumulation may drift by ~1 ULP between architectures;
 *   this is invisible visually but matters for cross-platform numerical
 *   diff testing.
 *
 * ## API stability
 *
 * The signatures below are stable. Adding new functions is fine; changing
 * existing ones requires explicit coordination so the companion viewer
 * stays in sync.
 *
 * For arbitrary-direction raycasts against obstacles (forward/side/up
 * beams, the obstacle ring), see `lib/terrain_sdf`; this library handles
 * only the heightfield and the near-vertical analytical fast-path.

 * Cast a near-vertical ray against the procedural terrain and return

 *
 * ANALYTICAL FAST-PATH ONLY. Use this helper for beams whose tilt off
 * the local vertical is small (≤ ~5°) — typically the downward
 * rangefinder on a level vehicle. For arbitrary-direction beams
 * (forward / side / up sensors, the obstacle ring), route through
 * `sdf_sphere_trace` in `lib/terrain_sdf` instead, which handles
 * steep oblique and upward beams correctly against both the
 * heightfield and a primitive scene.
 *
 * The beam starts at `(origin_n, origin_e, origin_alt)` with the
 * altitude axis positive UP (i.e. the world-frame altitude that
 * `terrain()` returns), and travels in direction
 * `(dir_n, dir_e, dir_alt)` where `dir_alt` is positive when the ray
 * points UP — a straight-down beam has `dir_alt = -1.f`. The direction
 * vector should be unit length; non-unit directions still produce a
 * correct intersection but the returned `t` then scales with the
 * input magnitude.
 *
 * For a near-vertical downward beam, the closed-form intersection is
 *
 *   t = (origin_alt - terrain(origin_n, origin_e)) / (-dir_alt)
 *
 * (a downward unit beam has `-dir_alt = 1`, so for pure-down `t` is
 * simply the altitude above ground). The analytical path approximates
 * the terrain function as locally flat over the small horizontal
 * projection a ≤5° beam covers — exact for straight-down
 * (`dir_n = dir_e = 0`), and sub-sensor-noise at the tilts a downward
 * rangefinder typically sees.
 *
 * If the input tilt is too large for the analytical approximation
 * (i.e. the beam is more than ~5° off vertical, including any upward
 * beam), this helper returns `max_t` (miss) rather than computing an
 * inaccurate answer. Callers must detect that case and re-issue via
 * `sdf_sphere_trace`.
 *
 * Returns `max_t` when no intersection is found within the search
 * range (e.g. an upward beam over open terrain) OR when the beam is
 * outside the analytical-fast-path envelope. The caller distinguishes
 * "hit" from "miss / out-of-envelope" by comparing the returned value
 * to `max_t`.

 * Configure the terrain function's parameters.
 *
 * Called by SIH at startup and on `parameters_updated()` to push the
 * `SIH_TERR_*` parameter values into the static state used by `terrain()`
 * and `raycast()`. This is the only piece of mutable state in the
 * library, and it is set-once-per-config-change rather than per-evaluation.
 *
 * When `amp == 0.f`, the terrain function returns `0.f` everywhere
 * (regardless of other parameters). This is the byte-identical-baseline
 * mode used when `SIH_TERR_EN = 0`: SIH calls
 * `terrain_set_params(0.f, ...)` and every subsequent `terrain()` call
 * is a free zero.
 *
 * When `plane_deg != 0.f`, the library enters deterministic planar mode:
 * `terrain(N, E) = tan(plane_deg) * N` and `terrain_gradient` returns
 * `(tan(plane_deg), 0)`. fBm evaluation is short-circuited entirely; the
 * `amp` / `wavelength` / `oct` / `hurst` / `erosion` / `seed` arguments
 * are stored but unused on the hot path. `terrain(0, 0) == 0` is
 * preserved by construction (no home-offset machinery needed). The mode
 * exists so acceptance tests that need a slope that is uniform across a
 * gear-footprint patch (e.g. the multirotor slope-tip test under
 * `sloped_landing_test.py`) have a deterministic surface to land on,
 * which fBm at the lattice origin cannot provide. When `plane_deg == 0.f`
 * the function is byte-identical to its pre-planar behaviour.
 *
 * The `home_n` / `home_e` arguments pin the home reference so that
 * `terrain(home_n, home_e) == 0` after this call. The current
 * implementation stores `(home_n, home_e)` and subtracts the noise value
 * at that point from every evaluation; the cost is one extra
 * subtraction per call. In planar mode these are stored but unused.
 *

 * @param oct         Number of fBm octaves to accumulate [1..9].
 * @param hurst       Hurst exponent [0.3..1.0]. Higher = smoother.
 * @param erosion     Slope-attenuated divisor strength [0..5].

 * @param plane_deg   Planar-mode slope angle [deg], tilted toward +N.
